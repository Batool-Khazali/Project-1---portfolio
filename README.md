# Project-1---portfolio
A portfolio made using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap (for the navbar) only.

The task was to use HTML, CSS and Bootstrap (for the navbar) only to create a professional, as much as possible, portfolio for ourselves.
I worked on it by designing and making a rough-draft, creating a template, adding text and photos and fixing the problems along the way by trial and error, before finalizing it and adding the finishing touches.

The inability to use JS was a challenge when I decided to add a carousel/slide-show for the projects section as almost all resourses I found used JS. Though, that didn't last long as I used the animation property to create it. The idea was scrapped in the end as it was slightly not-user-friendly.
Another challenge for me was giving the designing stage extra time more than I should. ( I changed the color palette 5 times before settling on one)

There are many things I enjoyed making this portfolio, but the ones that stand out to me are:
1) div.className is a friend
2) Using transition with opacity to create a text that appear over image
3) Progress bars and using :after
4) playing with the Form and its style
5) Selecting colors and font

Note: the experience and projects sections have the same end result and method (transition+opacity). The only difference is where the image is added, one as background, the other as separate div than text. I noticed it at the end but the end results are the same.

Hopfully, this portfolio lives up to your expectation.
